 1. INTRODUCTION                                         *VimSessionist-intro*

Vim supports sessions!! This means you can create project-specific workspaces 
(like IDEs), and open the saved workspaces directly. A session encompasses all
open files, the cursor-location within them, and other vim-options set while 
creating the session.

`VimSessionist` is a wrapper over the session-management commands in vim. It 
also automatically saves your last session.

 3. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS                             *VimSessionist-faq*

1. Why a new session manager?                           

Most of the existing session managers for vim (available on vimawesome.com) 
are resource-heavy and increase the vim startup time significantly. 
VimSessionist is just a wrapper over the existing session management capability
of vim (i.e., written purely in vimscript), autoloads features as and when 
required, and hence does not cause any noticeable performance lag.

2. In which mode should I enter VimSessionist commands?                          

All VimSessionist commands work in normal mode.

3. Previous session is not restored on my system OR The command SP does not
work.   

Automatically saving sessions on quitting vim is supported only by vim 7.3+.
So you need to upgrade your vim to be able to restore the previous session.

4. How can I save the current session with its existing name?         

Currently, this is not supported. However, keep checking for newer releases of
VimSessionist to get this and many other features.
